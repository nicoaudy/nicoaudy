**Hey, I'm Nico! 👋**

I'm a Software Engineer from Indonesia 🇮🇩 in love with JavaScript and (php) as well. My passion lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true. I currently learn Rust and Devops stuff💆‍♂️.

If I'm not coding or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/nicoaudy), I'm likely brewing coffee☕️.
